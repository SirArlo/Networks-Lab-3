a) 	Total execution time is 10 seconds which is time it takes for the first thread to run seeing as the counter is 10 times with a delkay of one second


b) 	The class myThread implements the threading and the modules of myThread(a,b,c,d) and the thread.start() function to create the threads


c)

1) 	The code now runs with five threads

2) 	The total execution time is the higest number of teh delay times the thread counter. Therefore it takes 20 seconds to complete 
	because the highestr value is delay of 5 with a counter of 4 for the fifth thread i.e 20 seconds to complete.

3) 	get_name(), active_count() and current_thread() have been implemented in the printing function.
